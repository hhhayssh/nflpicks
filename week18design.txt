//if the years have 2021 or greater, show the 
	//
	//	if somebody picks years 2020 and 2021
	//	and then picks...
	//		1. wild card
	//			that will be week 19
	//				it would bring back divisional games in 2020 and wildcard in 2021
	//
	//			probably need to redo the weeks table
	//			make a column called week_sequence_number
	//			need a column called "week_type" (playoff or regular season)
	//			if there's an option called "wild card", should the week say "wild_card" in its table?
	//			it should probably be "playoffs, round 1" or something because they'll probably change the playoffs at some point
	//			what if they reduce the weeks in the regular season?
	//			what if week 15 becomes the first round of the playoffs?
	//			there should probably be a separate csv file that controls that
	//
	//			there should be some kind of "marker" so that, if 15 becomes part of the playoffs, its marker is
	//			15-P, and the other years have 15-R
	//			then it can do a search for both in a single column without having to do an "and".
	//			otherwise, it would have to do something like this:
	//			where (week_label, week_type) in (('15', 'PLAYOFFS), ('16', 'REGULAR_SEASON'))
	//
	//			year	sequence_number			key							label						type
	//			2020	5						WEEK_5						Week 5						REGULAR_SEASON
	//			2020	18						WILDCARD					Wildcard					PLAYOFFS
	//			2020	19						DIVISIONAL					Divisional					PLAYOFFS
	//			2020	20						CONFERENCE_CHAMPIONSHIP		Conference Championship		PLAYOFFS
	//			2021	18						WEEK_18						Week 18						REGULAR_SEASON
	//			2021	19						WILDCARD					Wildcard					PLAYOFFS
	//			2021	20						CONFERENCE_CHAMPIONSHIP		Conference Championship		PLAYOFFS
	//
	//		now, if somebody picks 2020 and 2021, and then picks "Wildcard", this gets sent:
	//			years=2020,2021&weeks=WILDCARD
	//
	//		and the sql query is like "where year in ('2020', '2021') and marker in ('WILDCARD')
	//
	//		there needs to be a week_data csv.  it would have
	//		Year,Week,Week type
	//		2020,Week 5,Regular season
	//		2020,Week 18,Playoffs
	//		2020,Wildcard,Playoffs
	//		2021,Week 18,Regular season
	//		2021,Wildcard,Playoffs
	//
	//		would be nice if it "auto built" the menu off of what was there
	//		should it keep building the week and games off of the picks csv or should there be a separate "seasons" csv that has the seasons
	//		and weeks in it?
	//		either way, the picks csv needs to change and not use the week number in the week column ... it should "derive" the sequence from
	//		the ... sequence ... then it should use the "Week" as the label
	//		... it should be in the picks csv
	//		and the team data csv needs to change to
	//		conference,division,city,nickname,abbreviation,start_date,end_date,current_abbreviation
	//			
	//			we'll need to sort on "week sequence" usually
	//		
	//	with this design, if somebody picks 2020 and 2021, then picks wild card, what happens?
	//	it ... works
	//	need to rebuild from the bottom up:
	//		1. remake the week table - done
	//		2. remake the import process - it'll have to have some smarts and look at the year when deciding what to put in the week
	//		   it needs to fill in the key, type, and label ... the week can become the sequence number and the label will
	//		   - done ... i think
	//		4. remake the views - done
	//		5. update the functions to use the key instead of the week sequence number - done
	//		3. remake the menus - need to 
	//		4. hide week 18 if it's less than 2021 and show it if it's more ... filter like it does on the teams
	//			4a. could also have a season to week map ... the menu would have to be a distinct set of the weeks, sorted by sequence number...
	//			   but that could be a problem if the sequence number for WILDCARD in 2020 came before the sequence number for WILDCARD IN 2021
	//			   or that week 18 should be before the wildcard option ... it could sort and say "regular season is always first" and then
	//			   take the shortest sequence there
	//			   there need to be special options for all, regular season, and playoffs though, so the UI has to have some smarts
	//
	//				1. add default weeks (all, regular season, playoffs)
	//				2. get weeks from the data ... the weeks have a start and end season? ... but then that would have to be stored somewhere
	//				3. it could happen when loading the data ... seasons: [{year: 2020, weeks: [{week 1, week 2, ...}], 2021
	//				   or just weeks: [{label: week 18, marker: WEEK_18, startYear: 2021
	//				   i think that might work
	//				
	//				   select week, min(year), max(year) from week ....
	//		5. remake the urls for the playoffs and regular season ... regular season should add WEEK_18 if it was available 
	//		   there should be a "getAvailableWeeks(years)" that returns the values to use

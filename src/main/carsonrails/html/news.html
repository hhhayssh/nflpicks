			<p>Welp, I was driving down the road and it hit me ... The time do start the actual cars on rails project is now.  No clue how long it'll take but, in the words of Al Bundy...</p>

			<h3>Design</h3>
			<p>There are a few kind of big "design questions" that need to be taken care of I think:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Are you nuts?</li>
				<li>Will cars have their railroad wheels on them or will there be a "cart" or a "skate" with the actual railroad wheels on them?</li>
				<li>How will cars get on and off the railroad?</li>
				<li>Probably most important: is any of this worth it?</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Hmm well, after thinking about most of those for like a month, I think I'm ready with a few answers...</p>
			<div>
				<p>
					<b>Are you nuts?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Yeah, I probably am.  But, I'm not the first one to have this idea (fast forward to about 4:30) ... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSaSqE8xqSs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSaSqE8xqSs</a> 
					<br />
					Yep, that's right.  That good Canadian fellow had the same idea back in '95.  So, while I might be nuts, at least I'm not alone B-).
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
					<b>Will cars have their railroad wheels on them or will there be a "cart" or a "skate" with the actual railroad wheels on them?</b>
				</p>
				<p>After thinking about this for like 10 minutes, I decided it would be best if there was some kind of "cart" or "skate" that the car fit into instead of having the car carry its
				wheels around underneath like the "hi-rail" things do.  The reason is because that would be one more thing for people to take care of on their cars and people suck at taking care of their cars.
				If everybody had their wheels on their car, they'd have to be inspected to make sure they were good to go before getting on the track and that could take a while.  
				Plus, having them on a "cart" or "skate" makes it easier to fix the next problem...
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
					<b>How will cars get on and off the railroad?</b>
				</p>
				<p>Ah, the trillion dollar question.  If the cars are on the rails, how will the enter and exit?  Railroads have "switches" where another set of tracks kind of "diverts" the train.  But, if there are a lot of
				cars and they're going like 100-150 miles an hour, how would that work??  There's a flaw in the plan!!  It's an achilles heel!!  What 'cha gonna do???
				<br />
				Well, I was sitting in a walmart parking lot and thinking about this when it hit me...
				</p>
				<p>Exiting:</p>
				<div>
					<ol>
						<li>The "cart" or "skate" will attach to the rails like normal (with some kind of steel or aluminum railroad wheels).</li>
						<li>The car will be strapped into the skate with its wheels "secured" in divets or "bucket" like things so there's no chance it can move.</li>
						<li>The skate will have "arms" that are on its side.</li>
						<li>The arms will normally be tucked in when everything is moving: <a href="carsonrails/pictures/diagram1.jpg">Diagram 1</a></li>
						<li>When an exit is coming up, two more rails will show up <i>outside</i> of the first set of rails and they'll be rasied up a little bit: <a href="carsonrails/pictures/diagram2.jpg">Diagram 2</a></li>
						<li>If the skate exits, it'll "deploy" the arms and they'll connect with the second set of rails, rolling right along.</li>
						<li>The second set of rails will gradually "incline" and lift the skate up like a ramp: <a href="carsonrails/pictures/diagram3.jpg">Diagram 3</a>, <a href="carsonrails/pictures/diagram4.jpg">Diagram 4</a>, and <a href="carsonrails/pictures/diagram5.jpg">Diagram 5</a></li>
						<li>Because the second set of rails are <i>outside</i> of the first set, all of the cars that don't want to exit just have to keep their "arms" tucked in.</li>
						<li>The cars that are exiting will go up the ramp to some kind of "platform" and exit onto normal streets.  The cars that don't will just keep chugging along on the rails.</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
				<p>It could also work if the second set of rails kept going straight while the "normal" rails "declined".  
				Using that design, the cars that were exiting would go straight for a while and the cars that were staying on would go down a decline.
				</p>
				<p>Entering:</p>
				<p>This one is a little trickier because you have to merge with traffic that's already there.  The best way I can think of (so far) is to have it so entering is done in the same way, but it's only
				allowed when there are no cars coming that would cause a wreck.  So, there'll be some kind of automated system that looks down the track, checks how far away the next car is, and then figures whether it's safe to get on or not.
				</p>
			</div>

				<p>
					<b>Probably most important: is any of this worth it?</b>
				</p>
				<p>My initial "gut" reaction is that "yeah, it is," but I don't think that's good enough, is it?  So, it's time to dust off the ol physics stuff and run the numbers...
				The question is: how much energy does it save?
				</p>
				<p>To get the answer, we just have to break it down:
					<ul>
						<li>To push anything, you have to overcome the friction between whatever's being "pushed" (a car in this case) and whatever it's on (the road or some rails).</li>
						<li>The amount of friction is determined by the materials that are involved and the weight of what's being pushed.  If you try to push something on carpet, it's a lot harder to do than if it's on ice.</li>
						<li>So, basically, we have to figure out how much energy is needed to push a car on asphalt vs pushing that same car on railroad wheels.</li>
						<li>The amount of energy it takes to move a car (or anything else) is the amount of force needed to move it (how hard you have to push or pull) times how far you want it moved.</li>
						<li>Let's make it easy and say we want it moved 1 km.</li>
						<li>The "weight" of the car on the road or rails is the amount of force gravity is applying to the car (<i>F<sub>g</sub></i>) and it can be found by multiplying the "mass" (<i>m</i> of the car times gravity <i>g</i>): <i>F<sub>g</sub> = m * g</i></li>
						<li>A 2015 camry has a mass of about 4,500 lbs or 2040 kg</li>
						<li>So, the force of gravity on the car is: <i>2040 kg * 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> = 19,999.35 kgm/s<sup>2</sup></i></li>
						<li>Now, if the car is just sitting on the road and gravity is pulling on it, it's not falling through the road and so <i>it</i> must be <i>pushing back</i> against the ground with the same force (since it's not falling, it's just sitting there).</li>
						<li>That force is called the "normal" force and it's a little weird to think about (the car pushing back against the earth), but it's true because, otherwise, it would fall through the pavement right?</li>
						<li>So, the normal force, <i>N</i>, is also 19,999.35 kgm/s<sup>2</sup>.</li>
						<li>Now, friction between the two materials (tire and asphalt) figures in big time.  If you're driving and you take your foot off the gas, your car will eventually come to a stop because the friction between the road and the tires is "opposing" the movement of the car and that takes away from the energy that's moving it.</li>
						<li>So, there's some "factor" we have to kind of include in the analysis to account for friction.</li>
						<li>It turns out that "factor" is called the "coefficient of friction" and it even has its own symbol: "&mu;" (or "mu").  It's used to determine how much friction there is between certain kinds of materials.  Sandpaper, for example, has a high coefficient of friction.  Ice has a pretty low one.  Make sense?  No?  ... Good.</li>
						<li>After consulting my college physics book, I found out if we multiply this factor, &mu;, by the normal force of what's being moved, we'll find out how much force is being applied by friction to slow us down.  This will tell us how much force is needed in order to move.</li>
						<li>I luckily found a table that lists some values for &mu; (the "coefficient of friction") for different materials (<a href="https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/rolling-friction-resistance-d_1303.html">https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/rolling-friction-resistance-d_1303.html</a>):
							<ul>
								<li>Ordinary car tires on concrete: 0.01 - 0.015 (I'll go with 0.0125)</li>
								<li>Railroad wheels on rails: 0.001 - 0.002 (I'll go with 0.0015)</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>So, doing the math:
							<ul>
								<li><i>F = &mu; * N</i></li>
								<li><i>F = 0.0125 * 19,999.35 kgm/s<sup>2</sup></i></li>
								<li><i>F = 249.99 kgm/s<sup>2</sup></i></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>So, that means the friction between the tires and the road is applying 249.99 kgm/s<sup>2</sup> worth of "force" to the car as it's rolling along.  As that force is applied, the car loses energy and slows down.</li>
						<li>In order to move the car 1 km, we'll have to apply that force constantly in the opposite direction.</li>
						<li>Looking at the college physics book again, applying force over a distance is called "work" (<i>W</i>) and its units are "Joules" ... the units of energy.  So, that's what we're looking for.  The equation for work is pretty easy: <i>W = F * d</i></li>
						<li>We already have the force and distance, so we just have to multiply them to get what we want:
							<ul>
								<li><i>W = F * d</i></li>
								<li><i>W = 249.99 kgm/s<sup>2</sup> * 1,000 m</i></li>
								<li><i>W = 249,991.88 kgm<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup></i></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>So, it takes 249,991.88 Joules (what a "kgm<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>" is called) worth of energy to move a 2015 camry 1 km on concrete with tires.</li>
						<li>Now, how much energy does it take to move that same camry using railroad wheels?  Well, we have the equations already, so we just have to do them:
							<ul>
								<li>The normal force is the same: 19,999.35 kgm/s<sup>2</sup></li>
								<li>The coefficient of friction is 0.0015 now though, so:</li>
								<li><i>F = &mu; * N</i></li>
								<li><i>F = 0.0015 * 19,999.35 kgm/s<sup>2</sup></i></li>
								<li><i>F = 29.999 kgm/s<sup>2</sup></i></li>
								<li>The amount of energy needed to apply 29.999 kgm/s<sup>2</sup> over 1 km is:</li>
								<li><i>W = F * d</i></li>
								<li><i>W = 29.999 kgm/s<sup>2</sup> * 1,000 m</i></li>
								<li><i>W = 29,999.025 kgm<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup></i></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>So, it takes 29,999.025 Joules worth of energy to move a 2015 camry 1 km on railroad wheels.</li>
						<li>How much better is that than on a normal road?  Well, we just have to divide the amount of energy needed on the road by the amount needed by the railroad:
							<ul>
								<li>249,991.88 / 29,999.025 = 8.333</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>So, uh, that means it should be about 8.3 times more efficient to move stuff on rails instead of on the regular road.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Yeah, I'd say being at least 8.3 times more efficient is, uh, worth it.  It would be like getting 240 miles per gallon from a car.  And, the best part is, it'll be 8.3 times more efficient <i>no matter what the energy source of the car is.</i>  So, if you have an electric car, you'll have to use 8x less electricity using the rails.
				</p>
				<p>Editor's note: If you were using electric cars, there's no reason "skate" couldn't charge the car's battery as it's moving along.</p>

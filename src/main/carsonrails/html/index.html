		<p>Welcome to cars on rails.com.</p>  
		<p>One day in 2011, I was stuck in traffic and sitting on the highway when I thought, "Hmmm...
wouldn't it be a good idea if cars had railroad wheels on them and there were railroad tracks on the side of the highway so people wouldn't
get stuck in traffic like this?"</p>  
		<p>And the more I thought about it, the more sense it made. I mean, no matter what you use to power a car, if there's less friction, it'll use less energy moving around.  And cars that drive themselves?  A lot of work for what gain?  I'm pretty sure those computers will have problems and there'll be all kinds of accidents.  Plus it's better than that hyperloop garbage because, no matter how fast you get somewhere, if you have a hard time moving around when you get there, what was the point?  If you put railroad wheels on the bottom of cars, you get to use all the existing infrastructure, save energy, not have to drive on the highway, and I think it might create a decent number of jobs (retrofitting existing cars with wheels).  Plus the rail infrastructure could be built out as needed, little by little.  Anyway, I kept thinking about it and, when I decided to buy a domain name to host the <a href="http://carsonrails.com/nflpicks/">nflpicks</a> I do with friends and family, I figured making it related to that idea would be a good one.</p>
		<p>Eventually, I hope to actually <i>do</i> something with actual cars on rails <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">but I don't have time right now.</span>
and the <a href="news.html">time as come to do it.</a></p>

		<h3 style="padding: 10px;">NFL Picks Terms of Service</h3>
		<div style="padding: 10px;">
			<span>By communicating your picks to the Commissioner, you agree to the following terms:</span>
			<ol>
				<li>The Commissioner has the right and ability to unilaterally modify any term or condition at any time without prior notice.</li>
				<li style="padding-top: 5px;">The pick for each game is due before the game starts.</li>
				<li style="padding-top: 5px;">Free wins are given under the following conditions:
					<ol>
						<li style="padding-top: 5px;">All games on Thursdays, excluding the first game and the Thanksgiving games, are free wins.</li>
						<li style="padding-top: 5px;">All games played outside the United States of America are free wins.</li>
						<li style="padding-top: 5px;">All games played on weird days of the week (Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays) are free wins.</li>
						<li style="padding-top: 5px;">All Saturday games in late December are situation dependent.  The Commissioner will consult the Council of Champions when making a decision.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li style="padding-top: 5px;">The following people enjoy running their mouths a little too much and are "On Notice":
					<ul>
						<li style="padding-top: 5px;">Moe</li>
						<li style="padding-top: 5px;">Gary</li>
						<li style="padding-top: 5px;">Benny boy</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li style="padding-top: 5px;">The phrase "On Notice" means what the Commissioner wants it to mean when he wants it to mean it.</li>
			</ol>
